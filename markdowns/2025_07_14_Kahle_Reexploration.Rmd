## What does this do?

This script is for exploring the kahle et al data concerning splicing in cancer. We want  to find out a few things:

1) Unique splice junctions found in tumours versus normal
 1.1. Look for EGFRvIII --> glioblastoma
 1.2 Claudin 18.2 (although I recall this was tricky last time...) --> pancreatic / gastric
 1.3 CD44v6 (although the pipeline looks dead) --> Breast?
 
2) Looks for their peptide evidence and where we can find the elution profiles of these sorts of data

## Libraries and packages


```{r}

library(tidyr)
